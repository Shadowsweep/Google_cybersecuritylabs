# Malware Overview

## Virus
A virus is malicious code designed to disrupt computer operations and inflict harm on data and software. Unlike worms, viruses require user interaction for installation, often spreading through phishing campaigns where deceptive links or attachments are used to trick users into initiating the infection.

## Worm
Worms are self-replicating malware that can independently spread across systems. Similar to viruses, they need user initiation but can also propagate through tactics like malicious emails. Notable examples include the Blaster worm, which caused widespread disruptions in the early 2000s by forcing continuous shutdowns and restarts on Windows XP and Windows 2000 systems.

*Note: While worms were prominent in the mid-2000s, they are less frequently utilized in recent years.*

## Trojan
Trojans, or Trojan horses, disguise themselves as legitimate files or programs to deceive users during installation. Spread through malicious downloads, trojans rely on trickery to convince users they are acquiring harmless content, while in reality, they introduce malware that can spy on users, grant unauthorized access, and execute various malicious actions.
# VAdware

## Overview
VAdware, or Advertising-supported software, is a legitimate type of software that developers sometimes use to display digital advertisements within applications. It serves as a method for developers to offset production costs or offer products for free while monetizing through ad revenue.

## Malicious Variants

### 1. Spyware
Spyware, a potentially unwanted application (PUA), gathers and sells information without user consent. It often hides within bundleware, posing a challenge in open-source software development due to potential misuse.

### 2. Scareware
Scareware, another PUA, employs tactics to frighten users into infecting their devices. Fake warnings, seemingly from legitimate companies, are displayed through email and pop-ups, making users susceptible to false claims.

### 3. Fileless Malware
Fileless malware doesn't need user installation and resides in memory, avoiding the hard drive. Detection involves memory analysis, requiring expertise in operating systems.

### 4. Rootkits
Rootkits provide remote, administrative access to a computer, opening backdoors for other malware. Spread through droppers and loaders, these disguise themselves as legitimate files to deceive users.

### 5. Botnet
A botnet is a network of infected computers controlled by a single threat actor. Malicious files spread the infection, allowing the bot-herder to execute commands on the infected computers.

### 6. Ransomware
Ransomware encrypts an organization's data, demanding payment for restoration. With rising sophistication, these attacks, such as the WannaCry incident, can cause significant damage to organizations and customers.

## Pro Tips
- **Fileless Malware Detection:** Perform memory analysis for detection, requiring knowledge of operating systems.
- **Rootkit Identification:** Recognize droppers and loaders disguising themselves as legitimate files.

Stay vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity measures to protect against these various adware and malware threats.
