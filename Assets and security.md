# Symmetric Algorithms

## Triple DES (3DES)

Triple DES, or 3DES, is a block cipher that evolved from the original Data Encryption Standard (DES) developed in the early 1970s. In contrast to DES, 3DES uses a block cipher to convert plaintext into ciphertext in "blocks." DES initially employed 64-bit keys, while 3DES enhances security by utilizing 192-bit keys, tripling the key length. Despite its increased key length, some organizations are phasing out 3DES due to limitations on data encryption volume. Nevertheless, it continues to find use for backwards compatibility purposes.

## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Widely recognized as one of the most secure symmetric algorithms, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a cornerstone in contemporary cryptography. AES supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, providing robust security. The cryptographic keys generated by AES are deemed resistant to brute force attacks, with estimates suggesting that breaking a 128-bit key could take a modern computer billions of years.

# Asymmetric Algorithms

## Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)

Named after its MIT creators, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, RSA stands out as one of the pioneering asymmetric encryption algorithms. RSA operates by generating a public and private key pair. Asymmetric algorithms like RSA produce longer key lengths, with RSA supporting key sizes of 1,024, 2,048, or 4,096 bits. It is primarily employed to safeguard highly sensitive data.

## Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

Introduced by NIST in the early 1990s, the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a standard asymmetric algorithm. DSA, like RSA, generates key lengths of 2,048 bits. Widely used in conjunction with RSA in public key infrastructure, DSA plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital signatures.
